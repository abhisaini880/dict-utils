# To-Do List for "nestdict" Project

## Project: NestDict - Simplifying Nested Dictionary Operations

### Objectives

The "nestdict" project aims to create a Python library that simplifies working with nested dictionaries. It will address common issues developers face when dealing with nested dictionaries and provide features to enhance dictionary manipulation, key access, serialization, and more.
